# Quick Start
<Subtitle title="Fast lane"/>

## Installation

Because the program is on alpha at this point we just have one way to install it.
python ^3 is required.

```bash
$ pip3 install mmp
```

## First commands

For the program to work you need to use the python standard requirements.txt, I'm
thinking about moving that to a json base modules file but we will see how far
that future is.

You can use the mmp init to create your requirements.txt file and pip_modules.

<Callout>
  Adding pip_modules to git ignore its recommended
</Callout>

### Init

```bash
$ mmp init
requirements.txt pip_modules/
```

### Install modules

With this done you can start adding some modules to your project just by running

```bash
$ mmp install [module_name]
```

That command not only adds the module to your pip_modules the command also updates,
the requirements.txt file adding the module like this.

```text
[module_name]==[module_version_installed]
```

### Uninstall

You can also uninstall modules by running the uninstall command

```bash
$ mmp uninstall [module_name]
```

This will remove the module from the requirements.txt

<Callout emoji='👇🏾'>
  The program does not uninstall the modules that were installed with the uninstall
  module.
  <br/>
  If you want to reinstall all the modules run this command

  ```bash
  $ mmp clean
  ```
</Callout>


## Other people

For other people to install all the modules wen they clone the repository its ass
simple to just run

```bash
$ mmp install
```

This will install all the modules on the requirements.txt file

## Run project

To run your project using you pip_modules its super easy, you just need to add the
prefix mmp if you want to use a cli solution on your pip_modules or mmp run to run
your program

```bash
$ mmp orator make:migration Example -m
$ mmp run
```

### mmp run

The run command by default will run run.py file on the repository that the command
was used, but you can add a specific file to run by adding the path at the end

```bash
$ mmp run [path_to_file][file.py]
```

## Needing More

Every command on the cli has helps build in just add -h to whatever you want to
know about.

Also [here](docs) are a more deep documentation of the cli

  The deep docs are not ready yet
