## Why

The mmp project was created, to solve the library handling problem with python
the

```bash
$ source [path_to_virtualenv]/bin/activate
```

Was an excellent solution in the beginning but its not suitable for the standards
of today, python its getting better and better day by day and the community is one
of the largest.

I have been using libraries on almost every project that i have created with python
and the trouble of trowing this command to get a crontab running was to big of a
hassle.

```bash
$ [path_to_your_script][path_to_virtualenv]/bin/python [path_to_your_script][script_to_run]
```

Looking to that monstrosity doing this its a lot better

```
$ cd [path_to_your_script]
$ mmp run [script_to_run]
```
