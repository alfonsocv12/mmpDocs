# Intro to the cli
<Subtitle title="Know everything"/>

This cli program has been created basing on docker-compose structure. Using the
same [docopt](http://docopt.org/) library, this allows us to have a -h option on every command that we
have.

<Callout>
  I'm looking to make a refactor on the structure based on pip repository, because
  the single class its getting to big and a little confusing
  [pip source code](https://github.com/pypa/pip)
</Callout>

If you do the -h on the index command you can see all the commands available on
the cli.


```bash
$ mmp -h
Install and handle your pip dependencies fast and easy

usage:
    mmp [options] [--] [COMMAND] [ARGS...]
    mmp -h|--help

Options:
    -v, --version            Shows mmp version

Commands:
    run                      Run python files with the environment modules
    install                  Install your libraries on pip_modules
    init                     Create requirements.txt to to add python libraries
    upgrade                  Upgrade module on the pip_modules
    uninstall                remove libraries from pip_modules
    clean                    Clean all the libraries and reinstall requirements
```

Here we have all the specific commands that you can use. the only one that isn't
documented in here its the command bypass to the pip_modules.
