# Run
<Subtitle title="Scripts and Modules cli"/>

The first section of the cli is the run section, you can run your own python scripts
of your project or the cli solutions of your modules.

## Script

### Options

This are the available options on the run command, you can run without a specific
file that will take run.py ass the running file to load

```bash
Run python files with the enviroment modules

usage: run [<file>]
```

Or specifying a file by adding the file path and name after the run statement.

```bash
$ mmp run [path_to_file][file_name]
```

The default path is the relative path so if you'r in the file folder you can run
this

```bash
$ mmp run [file_name]
```

### Example

Taking this example into consideration

![img](/examples/run/code_structure.png)

Where requirements.txt file has this values

```text
orator=0.9.9
requests==2.25.1
```

And in the other hand run.py and run_2.py has this

```python
import requests
from orator import Model

print('run '+[1 on run 2 on run_2])
print(requests.get('https://google.com'))
```

The run.py its setted by default to the mmp run command but you can send a specific
one like this.

## Run.py file

In case that you want to define scripts to run simple create a run.py file with
this structure.

<Callout>
  This is the same as runing mex command so python before what you want to do
  is required
</Callout>

```python
SCRIPTS = {
    'start': "python (Here is where your scripts will go)"
}
```

Keep in mind that run is used to mmp run a file so its not possible to use it in
scripts file

## Modules cli

In the case that you install a module that has some cli commands that you want to
run, you can use mex.

```bash
$ mex orator make:model Example -m
```
